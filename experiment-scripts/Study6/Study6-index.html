	Each month is worth a certain amount of points. \
	So suppose 'SEPTEMBER' is worth 10 points, and 'MARCH' is worth 1 point. \
	If you choose 'SEPTEMBER', you would earn 10 points; if you choose 'MARCH', you would earn 1 point. <b>If you choose words with higher point values, you'll win more money.</b> We'll explain how this works in the next few pages.",
	"On every trial, we'll give you a choice between two of the words.\
	For example, you might have to choose between 'SEPTEMBER' and 'MARCH'. Here's what it will look like:<br><br>\
	<div align='center'><table>\
	<tr><th class='big' style='border: 5px solid white'>SEPTEMBER</th><td>or</td><th class='big' style='border: 5px solid white'>MARCH</th></tr></table></div> \
	<br><br>In our example, if you choose SEPTEMBER, you'd win 10 points; if you choose MARCH, you'd win 1 point. After you make your choice, we'll tell you how many points each word was worth.",

	This can add up to a lot of bonus money if you play well.<br><br>\
	You should do your best to pay attention, because the information in Part 1 will also be critical for you to earn \
	more bonus money in later parts. <b>If you don't pay attention in Part 1, you will earn less bonus money throughout the whole game.</b> \
	You should pay attention to all the words we show you, and to the amount of points they're worth.<br><br>\
	People who pay attention tend to earn about $1 - $2 more than people who don't.",

	If you want a hint, you can click that button. This will help you learn the word values.<br><br>\
	But, later in the game, <b>we will take away this button</b>, and you'll have to work from memory. The hint button will disappear between trials 30-40. Thus, if you want to win bonus points later on, you have to pay attention and <b>try to learn which words are good and bad</b>.",

	For example, we might ask you to think of a word that has the most vowels in it. The more vowels in the word you think of, the more bonus money you win. \
	So 'CONSTITUTIONAL' would be a good word, because it has 6 vowels. But you wouldn't actually be able to use 'CONSTITUTIONAL' - you'd have to pick a word you saw in Part 1.<br><br>Make sense?",
	"The amount of bonus money that a word is worth in Part "+whichPart_qs+" is completely determined by the question we ask. \
	So for example, if we asked you to give us a word that has the most vowels in it, the bonus money would be determined only by \
	the number of vowels in the word.<br><br><b>The amount of money that the word was worth in Part 1 is no longer important, \
	and will not affect anything in Part "+whichPart_qs+".</b> So if a word was really bad in Part 1, \
	but it has a lot of vowels, it would be a good answer to this question. \
	Similarly, if a word was really good in Part 1, but it doesn't have many vowels, \
	it would be a bad answer to this question. There is no relation between the values in Part 1 and the values in Part "+whichPart_qs+".<br><br>",
	"Just as before, please don't physically write anything down (like with pencil and paper) during Part "+whichPart_qs+". \
	We'll give you a virtual 'notepad' for each question, if you need space to write while you're thinking. It will look like this: <br><br> \
	Virtual notepad (don't enter final answer here):<br>\
	<textarea rows='5' cols='100'></textarea><br><br>\
	Anything you write in the notepad will not affect your bonus payment - it's just there to help you.",

	Enter your word here:<br>\
	<textarea rows='1' cols='40'></textarea></div>\
	<br><br>You will have a limited amount of time to answer the question. We'll give you a timer that shows how much time you have left. <b>You must write down your word within the time limit, or you won't get any bonus money for this part.</b> The screen will automatically advance when the timer reaches zero.",
	"So, to summarize: We'll ask you to think of a word from Part 1 with a certain property. You'll have to think of your word within a time limit. The whole screen will look like this:<br><br>\
	<div style='border: 1px solid black; padding: 10px'><span style='color: red; font-size: 16pt'>X seconds left to answer</span><br><br>\
	Virtual notepad (don't enter final answer here):<br>\

	Enter your word here:<br>\
